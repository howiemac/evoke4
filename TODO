BUG
==
- data.list() cannot cope with a "where" parameter for any word(s) starting with s - eg where="%%star%%"
  eg see base.Page.page.py line 1152: heads.extend(self.list(where='name like "%%%s%%"' % term,orderby='uid desc'))
  because of base.data.py line  402:  whereclauses = (' and '.join(sqlparts)).replace("%","%%").replace('%%s','%s') # double the % wildcard (but not any %s)
  i.e. The substitution of "%%s" is a bodge too far! REVERT TO PRE - SQL INJECTION PROTECTION data.py (ie as per grace 8)
CURRENTLY BODGED BY FORCING UPPERCASE FOR SEARCH TERM IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE.....

URGENT
==
- exclude drafts from listings (optionally via preference?)
- move / copy
- user mode



LATER
==
- import/export

- replace req.req and url.req with the new mp.base versions...

- there should be a base EvoType object, even if it only has the __hash__ declaration in it. 

 - user sessions
    * migrate session table to session cache (CJH)
    * flat files are all currently going through validation (not relevant when fielded by apache) (CAN I MAKE THIS SWITCHABLE VIA A CONFIG const?)

- we need to be able to add and include types in apps, so that e.g. lib/TEXT() can be put in Page app (where it belongs)


PROPOSALS
==
- rename "base" folder to "evoke" ?  (IHM)
