URGENT
==
- exclude drafts from listings (optionally via preference?)
- move / copy
- user mode



LATER
==
- import/export

- replace req.req and url.req with the new mp.base versions...

- there should be a base EvoType object, even if it only has the __hash__ declaration in it. 

 - user sessions
    * migrate session table to session cache (CJH)
    * flat files are all currently going through validation (not relevant when fielded by apache) (CAN I MAKE THIS SWITCHABLE VIA A CONFIG const?)

- we need to be able to add and include types in apps, so that e.g. lib/TEXT() can be put in Page app (where it belongs)
